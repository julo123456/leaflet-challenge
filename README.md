# leaflet-challenge
Used United States Geological Survey data (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to perform web visualization, using Leaflet D3.json to create a map that plots earthquakes from this survey data based on their location.

The web visualization reflects the magnitudes and depth of earthquakes: sizes of circle markers on the web reflects on the magnitudes while colors are based on the depth. Popups provides additional information.
